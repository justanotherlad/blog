      <p class="p1">Well firstly, those who don't know about ICPC, it is the IOI for colleges, much like Putnam for maths (except that in Putnam, only specific colleges are allowed). There are several stages, namely an Online Round, followed by an On-site Regional Round (the top team of each college from the Online Round comes here, generally speaking), followed by a Sub-Continental Semis, and finally the World Finals!<br>
      <span class="newline">
      Making it to the World Finals is huge, and you materialistically get awarded with direct offers from Google, etc.</span>
      </p>

      <p>So, is this blog about how three dudes worked their asses off super hard to finally go to the World Finals?<br>
      <span class="sadlyno">Sadly, No.</span><br>
      <span class="notall">Not all blogs are so motivational.</span><br>
      </p>
      <p>
      This blog is more realistic, where three lads managed to go to the On-Site Regionals after topping their college with little practice, fucked up there, and then came back.<br>

      <p>Welcome to my blog. Here we go:<br> (Disclaimer: We were so inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apOzEHkXgkg" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color:  #267d4d ; outline: none;"><i> Rajdeep Karmakar's</i></a> VLOG that we had decided to make something of a meme vlog ourselves from beforehand  (>.<) )

      <p class="p2">So <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/ray0410" target="_blank" style="outline: none;text-decoration: none;color:  #3384a3 ">ray0410</a>, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/kartikay101" target="_blank" style="outline: none;text-decoration: none;color:  #3384a3 ">kartikay101</a> and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/justanotherlad" target="_blank" style="outline: none;text-decoration: none;">I</a> had teamed up for the Online Round in October. We were certainly not the best team in our college. But after the Online Round, we were going to the Regionals in December.</p>

      <br><br><br>
      <p>We boarded an overnight bus from Chennai to Ernakulam. We had a li'l bit of vodka with us (I can write about it now, as we're over age). Kartikay was too pure for all these, so he slept.<br>
      Bus rides are usually not too pleasant. But vodka is.<br><br>
      We reached Kerela early in the next morning, but Amritapuri was still 2.5hrs away. We had to go by changing multiple vehicles, and we reached finally, after standing throughout in a bus, a place which was pretty much in the middle of nowhere.
