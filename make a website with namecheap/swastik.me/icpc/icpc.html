      <p class="p1">Well firstly, those who don't know about ICPC, it is the IOI for colleges, much like Putnam for maths (except that in Putnam, only specific colleges are allowed). There are several stages, namely an Online Round, followed by an On-site Regional Round (the top team of each college from the Online Round comes here, generally speaking), followed by a Sub-Continental Semis, and finally the World Finals!<br>
      <span class="newline">
      Making it to the World Finals is huge, and you materialistically get awarded with direct offers from Google, etc.</span>
      </p>

      <p>So, is this blog about how three dudes worked their asses off super hard to finally go to the World Finals?<br>
      <span class="sadlyno">Sadly, No.</span><br>
      <span class="notall">Not all blogs are so motivational.</span><br>
      </p>
      <p>
      This is a more realistic blog, where three lads managed to go to the Asia Amritapuri On-Site Regionals with little practice, fucked up, and then came back.<br>
